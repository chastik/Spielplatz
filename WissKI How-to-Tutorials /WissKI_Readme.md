# SODa WissKI Bits Tutorial

Join us to explore ontology-driven research data modeling with WissKI 

[ISWC 2025 - The 24th International Semantic Web Conference](https://iswc2025.semanticweb.org/)

Date: November 2-6,  2025

Location: Nara Prefectural Convention Center,  Japan


## Short Abstract

This hands-on tutorial invites researchers, data stewards, and ontology enthusiasts to collaboratively engage in building FAIR, semantically enriched collections. Guided by the TaDiRAH taxonomy and powered by Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SPARQL, CIDOC CRM), participants will model real-world cultural heritage entities, link open data, and publish interoperable knowledge graphs. Whether you're working on your own dataset or curious about Linked Data infrastructures—this is your opportunity to learn, experiment, and connect with peers.

## Target Group

Researcher, Data Steward, Ontology Engineer.

The tutorial is aimed at ontology engineers, knowledge graph developers, GLAM and digital humanities researchers, as well as data stewards, curators, trainers, and research data infrastructure providers. We expect 25 participants with diverse backgrounds in semantic technologies and applied data modeling.

Participants should have a basic understanding of RDF, OWL, or knowledge graphs, do not need prior experience with WissKI, and are expected to bring their own laptops.

## Teaching Strategy

**Demonstrative Learning**, **Learning by Doing**, and **Modeling form** together form an effective trio for software-based OERs: learners see real application steps, understand the processes behind them and try out what is shown for themselves. This promotes sustainable action competence, especially with complex digital tools from WissKI to SPARQL editors.

## Learning Objectives

Participants will:
* Understand the principles of ontology-driven semantic modeling and how to apply them in cultural heritage data using the Erlangen CRM and WissKI.
* Apply Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SPARQL) in the open-source WissKI environment for building, querying, and publishing FAIR data.
* Practice modeling structured collection data through hands-on, scenario-based exercises following a modular, activity-oriented path.
* Reflect on methodological aspects of knowledge graph construction and TaDiRAH-based learning design in the context of Digital Humanities and research infrastructures.
* Collaborate in a learning community that fosters reuse, transparency, and sustainability through Open Educational Resources (OER) and ontology-aligned documentation practices.

## Speaker

The tutorial is performed by Dr. Canan Hastik, Interessensgemeinschaft für Semantische Datenverarbveitung e.V., c.hastik@igsd-ev.de. She is an expert in structured data and graph data within the Digital Humanities. Her work focuses on ontology-driven modeling, FAIR data publication, and the development of didactically grounded educational formats for research data management (RDM), data literacy and science.

Gudrun Schwenk is a research associate at the Interessengemeinschaft für Semantische Datenverarbeitung e. V., g.schwenk@igsd-ev.de. In the SODa project, she focuses on conservation and restoration documentation in scientific collections. She’s especially enthusiastic about semantic enrichment, CIDOC CRM, WissKI, and reflecting on and working with ontologies – always looking for ways to make data more meaningful (and a little more connected), and to help knowledge flow more easily between people, systems, and institutions.
