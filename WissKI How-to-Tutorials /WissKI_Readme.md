# SODa WissKI Bits Tutorial

Join us to explore ontology-driven research data modeling with WissKI 

[ISWC 2025 - The 24th International Semantic Web Conference](https://iswc2025.semanticweb.org/)

Date: November 2-6,  2025

Location: Nara Prefectural Convention Center,  Japan


## Short Abstract

This hands-on tutorial invites researchers, data stewards, and ontology enthusiasts to collaboratively engage in building FAIR, semantically enriched collections. 

Guided by the TaDiRAH taxonomy and powered by Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SPARQL, CIDOC CRM), participants will model real-world cultural heritage entities, link open data, and publish interoperable knowledge graphs. 

Whether you're working on your own dataset or curious about Linked Data infrastructures—this is your opportunity to learn, experiment, and connect with peers.

## Target Group

Researcher, Data Steward, Ontology Engineer.

The tutorial is aimed at ontology engineers, knowledge graph developers, GLAM and digital humanities researchers, as well as data stewards, curators, trainers, and research data infrastructure providers. 

We expect 25 participants with diverse backgrounds in semantic technologies and applied data modeling.

Participants should have a basic understanding of RDF, OWL, or knowledge graphs, do not need prior experience with WissKI, and are expected to bring their own laptops.

## Teaching Strategy

**Demonstrative Learning**, **Learning by Doing**, and **Modeling form** together form an effective trio for software-based OERs: learners see real application steps, understand the processes behind them and try out what is shown for themselves. 

This promotes sustainable action competence, especially with complex digital tools from WissKI to SPARQL editors.

## Learning Objectives

Participants will:

* Understand the principles of ontology-driven semantic modeling and how to apply them in cultural heritage data using the Erlangen CRM and WissKI.
  
* Apply Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SPARQL) in the open-source WissKI environment for building, querying, and publishing FAIR data.
  
* Practice modeling structured collection data through hands-on, scenario-based exercises following a modular, activity-oriented path.
  
* Reflect on methodological aspects of knowledge graph construction and TaDiRAH-based learning design in the context of Digital Humanities and research infrastructures.
  
* Collaborate in a learning community that fosters reuse, transparency, and sustainability through Open Educational Resources (OER) and ontology-aligned documentation practices.

## Speaker

The tutorial is performed by Dr. Canan Hastik, Interessensgemeinschaft für Semantische Datenverarbveitung e.V., c.hastik@igsd-ev.de. She is an expert in structured data and graph data within the Digital Humanities. Her work focuses on ontology-driven modeling, FAIR data publication, and the development of didactically grounded open educational (OER) formats for research data management (RDM), data literacy (DL) and data science (DS).

## Authors

**Canan Hastik** is a research expert specialized in analysis of structured data and graphs, research data management, digital and data science. She earned her PhD from TU Darmstadt in 2019 at the Institute for Language & Literature Studies, following a master’s in Information Science & Engineering and a diploma in Information & Knowledge Management with focus on library science. Her work focuses on heterogeneous data integration, semantic infrastructures, knowledge-base development, and the creation of Open Educational Resources (OERs) for FAIR RDM. She has led and contributed to national and international projects across the digital humanities, education, and library science. 

 
**Gudrun Schwenk** is a research associate at the Interessengemeinschaft für Semantische Datenverarbeitung e. V., g.schwenk@igsd-ev.de. In the SODa project, she focuses on conservation and restoration documentation in scientific collections. She’s especially enthusiastic about semantic enrichment, CIDOC CRM, WissKI, and reflecting on and working with ontologies – always looking for ways to make data more meaningful (and a little more connected), and to help knowledge flow more easily between people, systems, and institutions.



**Mark Fichtner** holds a diploma in computer science from the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. From 2009 to 2012, he played a key role in the development of the project “WissKI – Scientific Communication Infrastructure.” In 2012, he worked at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum on the digital implementation and long-term preservation of the project The Early Dürer. Since December 1, 2012, he has served as Deputy Head of the Department for Museum and Cultural Informatics at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, which he has led as Head of Department since January 1, 2020. Additionally, he has been a founding board member of the Association for Semantic Data Processing (IGSD e.V.), m.fichtner@gnm.de.

## SODa Project and Contact

SODa – Sammlungen, Objekte und Datenkompetenzen is a German national initiative that strengthens data literacy and research data management (RDM) skills for professionals working with academic collections. The project focuses on developing FAIR, open educational resources (OERs) tailored to collection-based research and digital scholarship.

SODa supports structured, interdisciplinary learning around data practices in the context of cultural heritage and research infrastructures. Its modular resources cover topics such as collection development, metadata and ontology modeling, semantic enrichment, data visualization, and digital documentation.

Learning designs are based on coherent personas and a learning objectives matrix for RDM, supporting both foundational knowledge and discipline-specific needs. Research-based and problem-oriented learning approaches encourage active engagement, practical application, and reuse across academic and heritage institutions.

SODa also fosters exchange and collaboration across communities through contributions to national initiatives such as the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) and promotes standards, good practices, and innovative workflows in semantic data modeling.

SODa is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and NextGenerationEU under funding code 16DKZ2016B.
